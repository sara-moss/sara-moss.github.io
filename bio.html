            <h2>
                The Basics
            </h2>

            <p>
                I currently live in Carrboro, NC. In December, I started a new job as a
                virtual teacher to an awesome group of kindergartners and first graders at an 
                online charter school in my home-state of Michigan called Uplift Michigan Online 
                School. Although I enjoyed teaching in traditional brick-and-mortar schools for 
                several years, I love teaching online.

            <h3>
                Hobbies
              </h3>
                 <p> 
                     My husband lovingly says I have a "hobby of making hobbies." This is definitely true in that 
                     I like to learn a lot of different things. 
                 </p>
         
                 <p>
                    Here are my current favorite hobbies:
                </p> 
                <ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal-lg list-group-horizontal-md list-group-horizontal-xl">
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Sewing:</strong>
                            After years of failing to figure out how to thread the bobbin on my 
                            sewing machine, I made it a goal during the pandemic to figure it out. 
                            I made a dress that was mostly wearable.
                    </li>
                                        
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Furniture Restoration:</strong>
                            I love finding worn out pieces of Furniture at the thrift store or next 
                            to dumpsters and giving them new life.
                    </li>
    
                                        
                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        <strong>Chess:</strong>
                            Like so many others during the pandemic, I watched <em>The Queen's Gambit</em> 
                            on Netflix an decided to learn to play chess.My husband had long been trying to 
                            teach me but I finally put in the effort and occassionally beat him!
